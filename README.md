#  Quant Finance with Python

This repository contains experiments in **quantitative finance**, combining  
classical portfolio allocation strategies with **machine learning / deep learning** models.


## What’s inside

### 1. Portfolio Optimization (Rule-based)
- **Equal-Weight (EW):** simple diversification, each stock gets the same weight.  
- **Inverse-Volatility (IVOL):** safer assets (low volatility) get higher weight.  
- **Benchmark:** S&P 500 for comparison.  
- **KPIs:** CAGR, Volatility, Sharpe ratio, Max Drawdown.  

➡ Goal: Show how simple rules can sometimes outperform the benchmark.

### 2. Machine Learning Models
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory):**  
  Predict future stock returns and volatility using time-series models.  
- **CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks):**  
  Learn from transformed financial signals (e.g., turning time series into images).  

Goal: Explore predictive power of deep learning in financial data.
